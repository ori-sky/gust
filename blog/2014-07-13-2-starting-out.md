Title: Starting Out

A video game is a work of art. Sometimes, game developers try to reduce game development to some magic formula of game idea 'generation', devoting entire schools of thought to character archetypes and making the design of a game conform to strict regulations.

I believe that the most important and prominent part of a game is the originality put into it by the developer, whether that be in the storyline or genre or even art style.
