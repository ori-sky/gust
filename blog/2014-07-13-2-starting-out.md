Title: Starting Out

A video game is a work of art. Sometimes, game developers try to reduce game development to some magic formula of game idea 'generation', devoting entire schools of thought to character archetypes and making the design of a game conform to strict regulations.

I believe that the most important and prominent part of a game is the originality put into it by the developer, whether that be in the storyline or genre or even art style. Particularly in recent years, more and more games are throwing away the traditional genres and moving to more artistic genres.

Take [Proteus](http://www.visitproteus.com/) for instance. In Proteus, player satisfaction comes not from overcoming a series of challenges or from some end goal, but from the experience of its unique artistic style. Whilst in my opinion a game needs to have actual challenges, whether explicit or created by the player, to provide enough satisfaction, a lot of my inspiration has come from intricately designed games like Proteus.

Reflecting on all of this, I have found myself with a brilliant game idea that I intend to use for this module's coursework. I really like the idea and feel that the actual implementation of it would be very fun. As such, I'm going to carry out this coursework to the absolute best of my ability and I intend to create the designed game at the end of all this.

I plan to make a detailed blog post about the game idea tomorrow.
