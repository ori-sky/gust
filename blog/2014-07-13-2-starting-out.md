Title: Starting Out

A video game is a work of art. Sometimes, game developers try to reduce game development to some magic formula of game idea 'generation', devoting entire schools of thought to character archetypes and making the design of a game conform to strict regulations.

I believe that the most important and prominent part of a game is the originality put into it by the developer, whether that be in the storyline or genre or even art style. Particularly in recent years, more and more games are throwing away the traditional genres and moving to more artistic genres. Take [Proteus](http://www.visitproteus.com/) for instance. In Proteus, player satisfaction comes not from overcoming a series of challenges or from some end goal, but from the experience itself.
